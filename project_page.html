<h4>Can Bitcoin really be considered digital Gold? </h4>       
           
<!-- 1) The aims of your project; -->     
<container class="bcontainerwriteup">    
           <h3>The aim of this project is to see whether Bitcoin can really be considered digital Gold. To do this, I will look at the recent prices of both assets and look at their correlation since 2010. For this project to be a success, it is vital to define what digital Gold would look in a hypothetical state.
<br> <br>I believe this would be characterised by an asset that is of course digital, implying it is easy to transport and that it can be used via technology, i.e., a phone or computer. 
<br> <br>More importantly, what is Gold? Gold is tangible and has been used as a medium of exchange for centuries. It has intrinsic value; this inherent value is derived from its scarcity so, it has a finite supply.
<br> <br>Nowadays, due to its characteristics, it is considered an inflation hedge and a safe haven asset as, over the years Gold has risen in value with the ever-rising cost of living. Therefore, my interpretation of Gold is an asset that is a secure, relatively predictable investment which is backed by physical bullions. These bullions will always have value as they can be melted down and used in jewellery, semiconductors and even medicine, to name a few use cases.

<container class="bcontainerwriteup">    
           <h3> The data used throughout this project are from the three data sources listed at the top of the page. I had to sign up for coinAPI and metalsAPI, so I could access their respective API keys for use in my live price charts. Bitcoinâ€™s live price graph uses coinAPI and will automatically update as the API link was included in the Vega specification. Whereas, the live Gold price graph uses data from metalsAPI and is written in-line JSON to display another skill I have learned. 
<br> <br>The rest of the graphs use data that I scraped using Python in Colab from investing.com. Using the investpy software library, I was able to easily access data for both Bitcoin and Gold from 2010. Utilising the Python script, I wrote, the majority of the process is automated which means my graphs can be updated in a matter of minutes with new data. I decided to use this website over Yahoo Finance as there was a larger dataset available for Bitcoin which traces back to August 2010 whereas Yahoo only has data going back to September 2014.

<!-- 4) Your conclusions; -->     
<container class="bcontainerwriteup">    
           <h3> My conclusion: Whilst Bitcoin does exhibit similar characteristics to Gold such as scarcity, transportability and liquidity, it would be farfetched to consider it digital Gold. This is primarily due to its extreme volatility hence, making it a speculative store of value. 
           Bitcoin has consistently outperformed Gold as an investment over the past 10 years but this depends on when that investment was placed - market timing is key.
